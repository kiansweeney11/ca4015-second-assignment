Git repo for second assignment of CA4015: Advanced Machine Learning. 

## Code to be viewed:
- data-processing.ipynb - this file contains our attempts at Random Forests, AutoML using the data containing nulls and our cleaning of the data also to get approriate headings etc.
- automl.ipynb - our automl approach with our imputed data with use of cross-validation.
- medium.ipynb - AutoML and RF approaches to predicting the medium of bacteria is contained in this file.

NOTE: I also added the output files for automl for the medium script. I decided
not to add all of these Automl folders as there would be too many and they could not
be moved to a seperate location.
